      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <h3>LEO A DALY, Omaha, NE â€” <em>Data Scientist (07/2022 â€“ Present)</em></h3>
      <p>As a data scientist embedded in a leading AEC firm, I bridge the gap between architectural project data and business decision-making. I lead the strategy and execution of machine learning, data pipeline automation, and knowledge systems that empower leadership to make informed decisions across multimillion-dollar projects. My work drives efficiencies in design intelligence, sustainability tracking, and cross-discipline collaboration through advanced analytics and AI integration.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed and deployed a Delta Lakehouse in Databricks to unify Revit and ERP data for analytics.</li>
        <li>Created ETL pipelines using Auto Loader and Delta Live Tables for structured/unstructured data.</li>
        <li>Trained ML models (XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Random Forest) to classify architectural room types.</li>
        <li>Fine-tuned spaCy NER models to extract specs, materials, and vendors from architectural documents.</li>
        <li>Built LangChain + FastAPI RAG system with Dockerized LLaMA 3 for secure document Q&A.</li>
        <li>Developed medallion architecture data pipelines with Unity Catalog access control.</li>
        <li>Built dashboards in Power BI and Plotly for project KPIs and LEED certification insights.</li>
        <li>Led the development of containerized AI microservices using Docker and FastAPI, deployed via GitHub Actions and Databricks workflows.</li>
        <li>Integrated generative AI capabilities via LLaMA and custom prompt pipelines for knowledge search and Q&A.</li>
        <li>Implemented MLOps best practices including model versioning, metadata tracking with MLflow, and staged CI/CD deployment pipelines.</li>
        <li>Deployed model-serving endpoints using cloud-native infrastructure (Databricks, Azure AI Foundry) with security-first and cost-optimized configurations.</li>
        <li>Acted as technical lead on full-stack prototype apps (Streamlit/Plotly frontend + Python/Flask APIs) to support design feedback loops in architecture workflows.</li>
        <li>Regularly collaborated cross-functionally with architects, BIM coordinators, and business stakeholders to ensure solutions addressed real operational needs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Baird Holm LLP, Omaha, NE â€” <em>Project Analyst (03/2019 â€“ 07/2022)</em></h3>
      <p>In this client-facing legal environment, I translated business challenges into technical solutions that improved firm performance and client satisfaction. By leading automation and data strategy initiatives, I enabled attorneys and executives to reduce overhead, gain real-time insights, and increase billable efficiency. My leadership in vendor transitions, workflow modernization, and KPI reporting directly contributed to cost savings and stronger client outcomes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Built business process automation tools and legal transaction workflows to save attorney time.</li>
        <li>Led a firm-wide eDiscovery vendor transition, saving $200k+ and hundreds of paralegal hours.</li>
        <li>Created dashboards and SQL queries to fulfill executive and client data requests.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Union Pacific â€” Multiple Roles (2011 â€“ 2018)</h3>
      <p>Throughout multiple operational roles, I led safety innovation and enterprise technology programs that improved reliability and performance across the railroad network. I introduced agile methodologies, spearheaded derailment prevention strategies, and built a pioneering drone programâ€”all focused on risk reduction and scalable process improvement. My work blended engineering rigor with business strategy to enhance system safety, cost efficiency, and regulatory compliance.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed drone inspection and safety analysis programs as Manager, Derailment Prevention.</li>
        <li>Led agile software and safety system projects as Project Engineer.</li>
        <li>Maintained enterprise systems and application uptime as LAN Administrator.</li>
      </ul>
